Interactive 3D Earth Visualization

Description

This repository contains the source code for an interactive 3D visualization of the Earth using WebGL. The application allows users to view the globe with various textures that simulate natural phenomena such as cloud cover and night lights. It is built using WebGL2.0 and GLSL for rendering, along with HTML and CSS for the web interface.

Features

Real-Time 3D Rendering: Utilizes WebGL for high-performance graphics directly in the browser.
Shader-Based Graphics: Custom vertex and fragment shaders are written in GLSL to handle dynamic lighting, texture mapping, and reflections.
Interactive Controls: Users can rotate the globe, zoom in and out, and switch between various visualization modes such as natural appearance, night lights, and cloud cover.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
